    "2. We then scale the efficiency so that we can obtain a value between 0 & 1. We will then decide on a threshold which can determine if a station is efficient or not. (For eg. taking the threshold as 0.5, any station with efficiency greater than 0.5 would be efficient and lesser than 0.5 would be inefficient.)\n",
